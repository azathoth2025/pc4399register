## Overview

This directory is designed to host the packed `pc4399` module for easy installation and execution. After placing the package file here, install dependencies with your preferred package manager and run the script to start the application.

## Setup & Run Instructions

1. Copy the packed `pc4399` package (e.g., `pc4399-<version>.tgz`) into the `pc4399register` directory.
2. Install dependencies using one of the following commands:

**npm:**
```bash
npm install
````

**pnpm:**

## Notes

* A `503 Service Unavailable` typically means the target server is temporarily unable to fulfill the request.
* In such cases, integrating a **proxy pool** (a set of rotating IPs) may improve reliability by avoiding request blocking or rate-limit issues. Proxy pools are commonly used for scenarios like web scraping, distributed requests, or restricted network environments.
